# About
I am Gabriela Juncosa, a **PhD candidate of Network Science** at Central European University. Currently writing up my dissertation, I expect to complete all work for my doctoral degree by August 2024. I am a **Digital Behaviour Researcher** interested in how Network and Data Science methods can aid our understanding of sociocultural phenomena in digital society. 

My doctoral dissertation explores the **dynamics of online behaviour**, focusing on how individuals navigate online social environments and enact their online behaviours. I'm interested in how our biases affect what we say and how they can make us hold back. Specifically, I'm looking at online contexts where people feel pressured to stay quiet and how these individual decisions interact to distort our understanding of what's popular online. To tackle this, I combine **empirical and experimental methods**.

I aim to continue leveraging the complementarity of empirical and experimental methods to deepen our understanding digital behaviour, while simultaneously producing research that is socially relevant, open and reproducible. I am committed to continuing the study of available **social media data**, as there is still much to be learned about the complex interactions that are facilitated, suppressed, or amplified. However, I acknowledge that observational social media data alone cannot adequately address relevant research questions regarding online behavior. Carefully designed **online social experiments** can effectively bridge this gap. As social media platforms increasingly limit access for such experiments, I'm eager to partner with fellow digital behavior researchers to enhance existing infrastructures and facilitate experimental research.
