# About
I am Gabriela Juncosa, a PhD candidate of Network Science at Central European University. Currently writing up my dissertation, I expect to complete all work for my doctoral degree by August 2024.

I am a Digital Behaviour Researcher interested in how Data Science and Network Science methods can aid our understanding of sociocultural phenomena in digital society. 

My current research consists on studying the capabilities and limitations of community detection methods, mainly stochastic block models (SBMs), in empirical settings. The main approach consists on carrying out large scale studies assessing the quality of fit of SBMs in a corpus of hundreds of empirical networks. In particular, we compare networks generated by the inferred model with the empirical network, according to a set of network descriptors. We have also conducted a similar study in a more realistic scenario which considers networks having measurement errors. We assume each empirical network to be error-free, simulate a measurement process by introducing noise, and perform network reconstruction using the SBM. We assess the model by comparing the reconstructed networks to the original, according to a set of descriptors.

In the future, I would like to learn more about statistical network models and its applications to social sciences.
One direction points to understanding assumptions or biases in community detection models, and features of social phenomena that are not being captured by these tools.
Another direction points to learning the nuances in the study of social phenomena. One needs to acknowledge and identify potential errors and biases in the data collection process to correctly account for in the modelling process.
I would also like to collaborate with other researchers to study from social problems in a statistically principled way. I believe that we can harness the robust methodological framework of SBMs to obtain insights on such kind of problems.
